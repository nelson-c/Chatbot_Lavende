# Chatbot_Lavende

The chatbot is designed to act as a friendly companion for college students to relieve stress. It has three different personalities (savage, agreeable, optimistic) and one personality is chosen randomly at the start of the conversation. In the first few turns of the conversation, it identifies the user’s stressor and will converse accordingly. In addition, it will analyze the user’s personality based on the user’s response and gives a customized encouragement at the end of the conversation.
